# Alura Advanced JavaScript

Through this repository you can see my evolution during the course i did in Alura, the focus of this course is in advanced JavaScript, using MVC.

### 1 - First Class and First Commit
  In the first class i created and developed a function to populate an table with the form data, this table was created entirely using JS, basically i implemented a event listener on submit button, where the data catched in the inputs `Data` `Quantidade` and `Valor` was insered in a new line of the table.


### 2 - Second Class and Second Commit
  In the second class i implemented a new class to the application, the Negotiation class. In this class we have a constructor and this constructor receive 3 params, `Date`, `Amount`, `Value`. These attributes can be listed using the methods also implemented in this class, the methods:
  
  - getVolume => Returns Volume of the Negotiation. 
  - getDate => Returns Date of the Negotiation. 
  - getAmount => Returns Amount of Negotiation. 
  - getValue => Returns Value of Negotiation.
