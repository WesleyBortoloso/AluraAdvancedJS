# Alura Advanced JavaScript

Through this repository you can see my evolution during the course i did in Alura, the focus of this course is in advanced JavaScript, using MVC.

### 1 - First Class and First Commit
  In the first class i created and developed a function to populate an table with the form data, this table was created entirely using JS, basically i implemented a event listener on submit button, where the data catched in the inputs `Data` `Quantidade` and `Valor` was insered in a new line of the table.
